/*
To compile Java code with the javac command, the file must have the extension .java.
The name of the file must match the name of the public class.
The result is a file of bytecode with the same name but with a .class filename extension.
Remember that bytecode consists of instructions that the JVM knows how to execute.
Notice that we must omit the .class extension to run Zoo.class.
